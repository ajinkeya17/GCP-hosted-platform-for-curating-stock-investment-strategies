# GCP-hosted-platform-for-curating-stock-investment-strategies
Designed an ETL pipeline on GCP where multiple cloud functions are scheduled to trigger on a daily basis to pull stock market data for 10 prominent stocks from yahoo finance, relevant tweets about the companies and the news coverage for the stocks. This data was processed and stored in a GCS buket. From the GCS bucket an Apache Beam based Cloud Dataflow job prepared and streamed the data into a Big Query data warehouse. The Big Query tables power the final user facing Looker dashboard which displays a consolidated view into the stock's objective performance through data such as rolling average trends of the stock price, social media sentiment around the stock and insights from traditional media coverage around the stock for the end user to learn about the stock performance and predictable future trends to make informed investment decisions.
